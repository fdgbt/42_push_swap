** USAGE **

Single mode examples:

 ./push_swap [NB1] [NB2] [NB3] [NB4] [...]

 ./checker [NB1] [NB2] [NB3] [NB4] [...] [-v] [-c] [-h] [...]
 
 ./checker [-v] [-c] [-h] [...] [NB1] [NB2] [NB3] [NB4] [...]

 ./checker [...] [NB1] [-v] [NB2] [-c] [...] [NB3] [-h] [NB4] [...]


Dual mode examples:

 ARG="[...] [NB1] [NB2] [NB3] [NB4] [...] [-v] [-c] [-d] [...]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

 ARG="`ruby -e "puts (0...500).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"` [-c] [-d] [-n] [...]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG


** HELP **

[ ]| Optional
   |   Means that all arguments are facultatives for usage.

-v | Verbose
   |   Print stack A then stack B after each instruction applied.

-c | Colors
   |   Use contextualized and ergonomic colors in terminal.
   | Warning
   |   Not recommanded if using I/O redirection in shell, e.g. with the operator '>'.

-r | Read from file
   |   Read/Write instructions from/to a file, for respectively checker/push_swap.
   | Warning
   |   The both programs can be used in Dual Mode and use the same instruction file at the same time.
   |   The instruction file will be created if not exist, otherwise it does NOT need to be cleaned.
   |   The path file must be provided as the next argument (see Example).
   | Example (Dual Mode)
   |   ARG="[NB1] [NB2] -r /home/inst_file [-c] [...]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

-w | Write to file
   |   It can be used instead of '-r' option for mnenonic help.
   | Warning
   |   The both '-w' and '-r' options are identical and do NOT need to be used together.
   | Example (Single Mode)
   |   ./push_swap [NB1] [NB2] -w /home/inst_file [-c] [...]
   |   ./push_swap [NB1] [NB2] -r /home/inst_file [-c] [...]

-i | Init from file
   |   Read all integers from a file to init stack A.
   |   The path file must be provided as the next argument (see Example).
   | Warning
   |   Only integers, one per line, are accepted as format for init file.
   |   Indeed, options can NOT be enabled by this way, they still must be provided as arguments.
   |   Also, all numbers initially provided as arguments are wiped.
   | Example
   |   ./checker [42] [-v] -i /home/init_file [-42] [-c] [...]
   |   The numbers as [42] and [-42] are wiped. The options as [-v] and [-c] are well enabled.

-n | Number of instructions
   |   Print the total number of instructions.
   | Warning
   |   To print the individual number of instructions, '-n' must be used in combination with '-v'.
   | Example
   |   ./push_swap [NB1] [NB2] -n -v [...]

-d | Display instructions
   |   Force the display of all instructions in the terminal.
   | Warning
   |   The both "checker" and "push_swap" programs must be used in Dual Mode to be relevant.
   |   Any program in Single Mode must be used in combination with '-r' or '-w' to be relevant.
   | Example (Dual Mode)
   |   ARG="[NB1] [NB2] -d [-c] [...]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
   | Example (Single Mode)
   |   ./checker [NB1] [NB2] -r /home/inst_file -d [c] [...]

-s | Step by step mode
   |   Force the program to wait the user press "[ENTER]" key after each instruction.
   | Warning
   |   The '-s' option must be used in combination with '-v' to be effective.
   |   The both programs must be used in Dual Mode to be relevant.
   |   With the "checker" program in Single Mode, the "[ENTER]" key must be pressed twice to finish. 
   | Example
   |   ARG="[NB1] [NB2] -s -v [-c] [...]"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

-h | Help
   |   Print usage examples + options description + instructions reminder + additional support texts.


** INSTRUCTIONS **

- sa | Swap stack A
- sb | Swap stack B
- ss | sa + sb

- pa | Push to stack A
- pb | Push to stack B

- ra | Rotate stack A
- rb | Rotate stack B
- rr | ra + rb

- rra | Reverse Rotate stack A
- rrb | Reverse Rotate stack B
- rrr | rra + rrb


** TIPS **

While using quotes:
 
 Enter "setopt shwordsplit" in ZSH terminal to enable the single line parsing mode.

While displaying the state of the stacks (-v):

 Enable infinite scrollback in | Terminator (Preferences -> Profile -> Scrolling).
			       | Iterm2 (Preferences -> Profile -> Terminal).

While waiting instructions:

 Press "[CTRL] + [D]" or "[ENTER]" keys to finish.
